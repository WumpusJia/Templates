— Built-in Function: int __builtin_ffs (unsigned int x)

Returns one plus the index of the least significant 1-bit of x, or if x is zero, returns zero.
返回右起第一个‘1’的位置。

— Built-in Function: int __builtin_clz (unsigned int x)

Returns the number of leading 0-bits in x, starting at the most significant bit position. If x is 0, the result is undefined.
返回左起第一个‘1’之前0的个数。

— Built-in Function: int __builtin_ctz (unsigned int x)

Returns the number of trailing 0-bits in x, starting at the least significant bit position. If x is 0, the result is undefined.
返回右起第一个‘1’之后的0的个数。

— Built-in Function: int __builtin_popcount (unsigned int x)

Returns the number of 1-bits in x.
返回‘1’的个数。

— Built-in Function: int __builtin_parity (unsigned int x)

Returns the parity of x, i.e. the number of 1-bits in x modulo 2.
返回‘1’的个数的奇偶性。
